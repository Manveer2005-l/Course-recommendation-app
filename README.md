#  Course Recommendation System

A machine learning-based system that recommends personalized courses to users using multiple models: **KNN**, **NMF**, **Neural Network**, and a **Hybrid Recommender**.
Applying different machine learning and deep learning algorithms and models , to find the best solutions for the company to recommend the best courses for each individual customer and imporove the customer retention rate and also reduce the customer churn rate .

##  Features
- Trained and evaluated models using Precision, Recall, RMSE, and MAE
- Calculated novelty metric â€” *Average New/Unseen Courses per User*
- Implemented clustering (KMeans) and PCA visualizations
- Integrated a Streamlit web app for interactive course recommendations

## KEY HIGHLIGHTS
-Genre Feature Engineering:CREATION OF GENRE FEATURES BY EXTRACTING KEY VALUES FORM THE RAW TITLE NAMES FORM EACH COURSE USING TEXT PREPROCESSING AND NLP TECHINIQUES AND LIBRARIES
-Synthetic User Simulation:CREATING SYNTHETIC USER DATA AND ASSIGNING RATINGS TO EACH COURSE RANDOMLY BY USERS BUT BASED ON A POPULARITY BIAS CALCULATED WITH THE NUMBER OF ENROLLMENTS FOR DIFFERENT COURSES .
-Hybrid Approach:COVERING BOTH CONTENT-BASED AND COLABBORATIVE BASED RECOMMENDATION SYSTEMS AND ALSO COMBINING BOTH APPROACHES AND ADJUSTING WEIGHTS ACCORDING TO THE RANK OF PERFROMANCES OF THE MODELS

##  Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.13  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Streamlit  
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code / Jupyter Notebook

## Results

Hybrid model achieved the best balance between accuracy and novelty
Successfully demonstrated how combining multiple recommender paradigms can enhance personalization and engagement
